!!! There is still a problem when trying to run the codes as some idl-modules seems to be missing. We are trying to update to version 8.4

How to run Anna's code:
open idl

First you need to compile the modules
>> @startup.bat

Then run the module
>> READ_IDXINFO

Now you can run the Lick measurement code
>> MEASURE_INDICES_NEW_REDUX
