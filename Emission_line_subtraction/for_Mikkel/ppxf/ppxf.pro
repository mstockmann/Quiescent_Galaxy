; NAME:
;   PPXF
;
; PURPOSE:
;   Extract galaxy stellar kinematics (V, sigma, h3, h4, h5, h6)
;   or the stellar population by fitting a template to an observed
;   spectrum in pixel space, using the Penalized Pixel-Fitting (pPXF)
;   method described in: Cappellari M., & Emsellem E., 2004, PASP, 116, 138.
;
;   The following key optional features are also available:
;   1) An optimal template, positive linear combination of different
;      input templates, can be fitted together with the kinematics.
;   2) One can enforce smoothness on the template weights during the fit.
;      This is useful to attach a physical meaning to the weights
;      e.g. in terms of the star formation history of a galaxy.
;   3) Additive and/or multiplicative polynomials can be included to adjust
;      the continuum shape of the template to the observed spectrum.
;   4) Iterative sigma clipping can be used to clean the spectrum.
;   5) It is possible to fit a mirror-symmetric LOSVD to two spectra at
;      the same time. This is useful for spectra taken at point-symmetric
;      spatial positions with respect to the center of an equilibrium
;      stellar system.
;   6) One can include sky spectra in the fit, to deal with cases
;      where the sky dominates the observed spectrum and an accurate
;      sky subtraction is critical.
;   7) One can derive an estimate of the reddening in the spectrum.

;
; INPUT PARAMETERS:
;   TEMPLATES: vector containing the spectrum of a single template star or more
;       commonly an array of dimensions TEMPLATES[nPixels,nTemplates] containing
;       different templates to be optimized during the fit of the kinematics.
;       nPixels has to be >= the number of galaxy pixels.
;     - To apply linear regularization to the WEIGHTS via the keyword REGUL,
;       TEMPLATES should be an array of two TEMPLATES[nPixels,nAge], three
;       TEMPLATES[nPixels,nAge,nMetal] or four TEMPLATES[nPixels,nAge,nMetal,nAlpha]
;       dimensions, depending on the number of population variables one wants to study.
;       This can be useful to try to attach a physical meaning to the output WEIGHTS, in
;       term of the galaxy star formation history and chmemical composition distribution.
;       In that case the templates may represent single stellar population SSP models
;       and should be arranged in sequence of increasing age, metallicity or alpha along
;       the second, third or fourth dimension of the array respectively.
;     - TEMPLATES and GALAXY do not need to span the same wavelength range. However
;       an error will be returned by PPXF, if the velocity shift in pixels,
;       required to match the galaxy with the templates, becomes larger than
;       nPixels. In that case one has to truncate either the galaxy or the
;       templates to make the two rest-frame spectral ranges more similar.
;   GALAXY: vector containing the spectrum of the galaxy to be measured. The
;       star and the galaxy spectra have to be logarithmically rebinned but the
;       continuum does *not* have to be subtracted. The rebinning may be
;       performed with the LOG_REBIN routine that is distributed with PPXF.
;     - For high redshift galaxies, one should bring the spectra close to the
;       restframe wavelength, before doing the PPXF fit, to prevent too large
;       velocity shifts of the templates. This can be done by dividing the
;       observed wavelenghts by (1+z), where z is a rough estimate of the
;       galaxy redshift, before the logarithmic rebinning.
;     - GALAXY can also be an array of dimensions GALAXY[nGalPixels,2] containing
;       two spectra to be fitted, at the same time, with a reflection-symmetric
;       LOSVD. This is useful for spectra taken at point-symmetric spatial
;       positions with respect to the center of an equilibrium stellar system.
;       For a discussion of the usefulness of this two-sided fitting
;       see e.g. Section 3.6 of Rix & White (1992, MNRAS, 254, 389).
;     - IMPORTANT: 1) For the two-sided fitting the VSYST keyword has to be used.
;       2) Make sure the spectra are rescaled to be not too many order of
;       magnitude different from unity, to avoid over or underflow problems
;       in the calculation. E.g. units of erg/(s cm^2 A) may cause problems!
;   NOISE: vector containing the 1*sigma error (per pixel) in the galaxy spectrum.
;       If GALAXY is a Nx2 array, NOISE has to be an array with the same dimensions.
;     - IMPORTANT: the penalty term of the pPXF method is based on the *relative*
;       change of the fit residuals. For this reason the penalty will work as
;       expected even if no reliable estimate of the NOISE is available
;       (see Cappellari & Emsellem [2004] for details).
;       If no reliable noise is available this keyword can just be set to:
;           NOISE = galaxy*0+1 ; Same weight for all pixels
;   VELSCALE: velocity scale of the spectra in km/s per pixel. It has to be the
;       same for both the galaxy and the template spectra.
;   START: two elements vector [velStart,sigmaStart] with the initial estimate
;       for the velocity and the velocity dispersion in km/s.
;     - Unless a good initial guess is available, it is recommended to set the starting
;       sigma >= 3*velScale in km/s (i.e. 3 pixels). In fact when the LOSVD is severely
;       undersampled, and far from the true solution, the chi^2 of the fit becomes weakly
;       sensitive to small variations in sigma (see pPXF paper). In some instances the
;       near-constancy of chi^2 may cause premature convergence of the optimization.
;     - In the case of two-sided fitting a good starting value for the
;       velocity is velStart=0.0 (in this case VSYST will generally be nonzero).
;       Alternatively on should keep in mind that velStart refers to the first
;       input galaxy spectrum, while the second will have velocity -velStart.
;   MAXV: scalar, maximum value for fitted velocity in km/s wrt to initial guess
;   MAXSIGMA: scalar, maximum value for fitted sigma in km/s
;   MINSIGMA: scalar, minimum value for fitted sigma in km/s
;
; KEYWORDS:
;   BESTFIT: a named variable to receive a vector with the best fitting
;       template: this is a linear combination of the templates, convolved with
;       the best fitting LOSVD, with added polynomial continuum terms.
;   BIAS: This parameter biases the (h3,h4,...) measurements towards zero
;       (Gaussian LOSVD) unless their inclusion significantly decreses the
;       error in the fit. Set this to BIAS=0.0 not to bias the fit: the
;       solution (including [V,sigma]) will be noisier in that case. The
;       default BIAS should provide acceptable results in most cases, but it
;       would be safe to test it with Monte Carlo simulations. This keyword
;       precisely corresponds to the parameter \lambda in the Cappellari &
;       Emsellem (2004) paper. Note that the penalty depends on the *relative*
;       change of the fit residuals, so it is insensitive to proper scaling
;       of the NOISE vector. A nonzero BIAS can be safely used even without a
;       reliable NOISE spectrum, or with equal weighting for all pixels.
;   /CLEAN: set this keyword to use the iterative sigma clipping method
;       described in Section 2.1 of Cappellari et al. (2002, ApJ, 578, 787).
;       This is useful to remove from the fit unmasked bad pixels, residual
;       gas emissions or cosmic rays.
;     - IMPORTANT: This is recommended *only* if a reliable estimate of the
;       NOISE spectrum is available. See also note below for SOL.
;   DEGREE: degree of the *additive* Legendre polynomial used to correct
;       the template continuum shape during the fit (default: 4).
;       Set DEGREE = -1 not to include any additive polynomial.
;   ERROR: a named variable that will contain a vector of *formal* errors
;       (1*sigma) for the fitted parameters in the output vector SOL. This
;       option can be used when speed is essential, to obtain an order of
;       magnitude estimate of the uncertainties, but we *strongly* recommend to
;       run Monte Carlo simulations to obtain more reliable errors. In fact these
;       errors can be severely underestimated in the region where the penalty
;       effect is most important (sigma < 2*velScale).
;     - These errors are meaningless unless Chi^2/DOF~1 (see parameter SOL below).
;       However if one *assume* that the fit is good, a corrected estimate of the
;       errors is: errorCorr = error*sqrt(chi^2/DOF) = error*sqrt(sol[6]).
;     - IMPORTANT: when running Monte Carlo simulations to determine the error,
;       the penalty (BIAS) should be set to zero, or better to a very small value.
;       See Section 3.4 of Cappellari & Emsellem (2004) for an explanation.
;   GOODPIXELS: integer vector containing the indices of the good pixels in the
;       GALAXY spectrum (in increasing order). Only these pixels are included in
;       the fit. If the /CLEAN keyword is set, in output this vector will be updated
;       to contain the indices of the pixels that were actually used in the fit.
;     - IMPORTANT: in all likely situations this keyword *has* to be specified.
;   LAMBDA: When the keyword REDDENING is used, the user has to pass in this
;       keyword a vector with the same dimensions of GALAXY, giving the restframe
;       wavelength in Angstrom of every pixel in the input galaxy spectrum.
;       If one uses my LOG_REBIN routine to rebin the spectrum before the PPXF fit:
;           LOG_REBIN, lamRange, galaxy, galaxyNew, logLam
;       the wavelength can be obtained as lambda = EXP(logLam).
;   MDEGREE: degree of the *multiplicative* Legendre polynomial (with mean of 1)
;       used to correct the continuum shape during the fit (default: 0). The
;       zero degree multiplicative polynomial is always included in the fit as
;       it corresponds to the weights assigned to the templates.
;       Note that the computation time is longer with multiplicative
;       polynomials than with the same number of additive polynomials.
;     - IMPORTANT: Multiplicative polynomials cannot be used when
;       the REDDENING keyword is set.
;   MOMENTS: Order of the Gauss-Hermite moments to fit. Set this keyword to 4
;       to fit [h3,h4] and to 6 to fit [h3,h4,h5,h6]. Note that in all cases
;       the G-H moments are fitted (nonlinearly) *together* with [V,sigma].
;     - If MOMENTS=2 or MOMENTS is not set then only [V,sigma] are
;       fitted and the other parameters are returned as zero.
;     - If MOMENTS=0 then only the templates and the continuum additive
;       polynomials are fitted and the WEIGHTS are returned in output.
;   /OVERSAMPLE: Set this keyword to oversample the template by a factor 30x
;       before convolving it with a well sampled LOSVD. This can be useful to
;       extract proper velocities, even when sigma < 0.7*velScale and the
;       dispersion information becomes totally unreliable due to undersampling.
;       IMPORTANT: One should sample the spectrum more finely is possible,
;       before resorting to the use of this keyword!
;   /PLOT: set this keyword to plot the best fitting solution and the residuals
;       at the end of the fit.
;   POLYWEIGHTS: vector with the weights of the additive Legendre polynomials.
;       The best fitting additive polynomial can be explicitly evaluated as
;           x = range(-1d,1d,n_elements(galaxy))
;           apoly = 0d ; Additive polynomial
;           for j=0,DEGREE do apoly += legendre(x,j)*polyWeights[j]
;     - When doing a two-sided fitting (see help for GALAXY parameter), the additive
;       polynomials are allowed to be different for the left and right spectrum.
;       In that case the output weights of the additive polynomials alternate between
;       the first (left) spectrum and the second (right) spectrum.
;   /QUIET: set this keyword to suppress verbose output of the best fitting
;       parameters at the end of the fit.
;   REDDENING: Set this keyword to an initail estimate of the reddening E(B-V)>=0
;       to fit a positive reddening together with the kinematics and the templates.
;       After the fit the input estimate is replaced with the best fitting E(B-V) value.
;       The fit assumes the exctinction curve of Calzetti et al. (2000, ApJ, 533, 682)
;       but any other prescriptions could be trivially implemented by modifying the
;       function PPXF_REDDENING_CURVE below.
;     - IMPORTANT: The MDEGREE keyword cannot be used when REDDENING is set.
;   REGUL: If this keyword is nonzero, the program applies second-degree
;       linear regularization to the WEIGHTS during the PPXF fit.
;       Regularization is done in one, two or three dimensions depending on whether
;       the array of TEMPLATES has two, three or four dimensions respectively.
;       Large REGUL values correspond to smoother WEIGHTS output. The WEIGHTS tend
;       to a linear trend for large REGUL. When this keyword is nonzero the solution
;       will be a trade-off between smoothness of WEIGHTS and goodness of fit.
;     - The effect of the regularization scheme is to enforce the numerical second
;       derivatives between neighbouring weights (in every dimension) to be equal
;       to -w[j-1]+2*w[j]-w[j+1]=0 with an error Delta=1/REGUL. It may be helpful
;       to define REGUL=1/Delta and view Delta as the regularization error.
;     - IMPORTANT: Delta needs to be of the same order of magnitude as the typical
;       WEIGHTS to play an effect on the regularization. One way to achieve this is:
;       (i) divide the TEMPLATES array by a scalar in such a way that the typical
;       template has a median of one (e.g. TEMPLATES/=median(TEMPLATES));
;       (ii) do the same for the input GALAXY spectrum (e.g. GALAXY/=median(GALAXY)).
;       In this situation Delta and REGUL should be *roughly* of order unity.
;     - Here is a possible recipe for chosing the regularization parameter REGUL:
;          (i) Perform an un-regularized fit (REGUL=0) and then rescale the input
;              NOISE spectrum so that Chi^2/DOF = Chi^2/N_ELEMENTS(goodPixels) = 1.
;              This is achieved by rescaling the input NOISE spectrum as
;              NOISE = NOISE*sqrt(Chi^2/DOF) = NOISE*sqrt(SOL[6]);
;         (ii) Increase REGUL and iteratively redo the pPXF fit until the Chi^2
;              increases from the unregularized Chi^2 = N_ELEMENTS(goodPixels)
;              value by DeltaChi^2 = sqrt(2*n_elements(goodPixels)).
;       The derived regularization corresponds to the maximum one still consistent
;       with the observations and the derived star formation history will be the
;       smoothest (minimum curvature) that is still consistent with the observations.
;     - For a detailed explanation see Section 18.5 of Press et al. (1992,
;       Numerical Recipes 2nd ed.) available here http://www.nrbook.com/a/bookfpdf.php.
;       The adopted implementation corresponds to their equation (18.5.10).
;   SKY: vector containing the spectrum of the sky to be included in the fit, or array
;       of dimensions SKY[nPixels,nSky] containing different sky spectra to add to
;       the model of the observed GALAXY spectrum. The SKY has to be log-rebinned as
;       the GALAXY spectrum and needs to have the same number of pixels.
;     - The sky is generally subtracted from the data before the PPXF fit. However,
;       for oservations very heavily dominated by the sky spectrum, where a very
;       accurate sky subtraction is critical, it may be useful *not* to subtract
;       the sky from the spectrum, but to include it in the fit using this keyword.
;   VSYST: galaxy systemic velocity (zero by default). The input initial guess
;       and the output velocities are measured with respect to this velocity.
;       The value assigned to this keyword is *crucial* for the two-sided fitting.
;       In this case VSYST can be determined from a previous normal one-sided
;       fit to the galaxy velocity profile. After that initial fit, VSYST
;       can be defined as the measured velocity at the galaxy center.
;       More accurately VSYST is the value which has to be subtracted to obtain
;       a nearly anti-symmetric velocity profile at the two opposite sides of
;       the galaxy nucleus.
;     - IMPORTANT: this value is generally *different* from the systemic
;       velocity one can get from the literature. Do not try to use that!
;   WEIGHTS: a named variable to receive the value of the weights by which each
;       template was multiplied to best fit the galaxy spectrum. The optimal
;       template can be computed with an array-vector multiplication:
;           TEMP = TEMPLATES # WEIGHTS (in IDL syntax)
;     - When the SKY keyword is used WEIGHTS[0:nTemplates-1] contains the weights
;       for the templates, while WEIGHTS[nTemplates:*] gives the ones for the sky.
;       In that case the best fitting galaxy template and sky are given by:
;           TEMP = TEMPLATES # WEIGHTS[0:nTemplates-1]
;           BESTSKY = SKY # WEIGHTS[nTemplates:*]
;     - When doing a two-sided fitting (see help for GALAXY parameter) *together*
;       with the SKY keyword, the sky weights are allowed to be different for the
;       left and right spectrum. In that case the output sky weights alternate
;       between the first (left) spectrum and the second (right) spectrum.
;
; OUTPUT PARAMETER:
;   SOL: seven elements vector containing in output the values of
;       [Vel,Sigma,h3,h4,h5,h6,Chi^2/DOF] of the best fitting solution, where DOF
;       is the number of Degrees of Freedom (number of fitted spectral pixels).
;       Vel is the velocity, Sigma is the velocity dispersion, h3-h6 are the
;       Gauss-Hermite coefficients. The model parameter are fitted simultaneously.
;     - I hardcoded the following safety limits on the fitting parameters:
;         a) Vel is constrained to be +/-2000 km/s from the first input guess
;         b) velScale/10 < Sigma < 1000 km/s
;         c) -0.3 < [h3,h4,...] < 0.3 (limits are extreme value for real galaxies)
;     - In the case of two-sided LOSVD fitting the output values refer
;       to the first input galaxy spectrum, while the second spectrum will
;       have by construction kinematics parameters [-Vel,Sigma,-h3,h4,-h5,h6].
;       If VSYST is nonzero (as required for two-sided fitting), then the
;       output velocity is measured with respect to VSIST.
;     - IMPORTANT: if Chi^2/DOF is not ~1 it means that the errors are not
;       properly estimated, or that the template is bad and it is *not* safe
;       to set the /CLEAN keyword.
;     - When MDEGREE > 1 then SOL contains in output the 7+MDEGREE elements
;       [Vel,Sigma,h3,h4,h5,h6,Chi^2/DOF,cx1,cx2,...,cxn], where cx1,cx2,...,cxn
;       are the coefficients of the multiplicative Legendre polynomials
;       of order 1,2,...,n. The polynomial can be explicitly evaluated as:
;           x = range(-1d,1d,n_elements(galaxy))
;           mpoly = 1d ; Multiplicative polynomial
;           for j=1,MDEGREE do mpoly += legendre(x,j)*sol[6+j]
;
;--------------------------------
; IMPORTANT: Proper usage of pPXF
;--------------------------------
;
; The PPXF routine can give sensible quick results with the default BIAS
; parameter, however, like in any penalized/filtered/regularized method, the
; optimal amount of penalization generally depends on the problem under study.
;
; The general rule here is that the penalty should leave the line-of-sight
; velocity-distribution (LOSVD) virtually unaffected, when it is well
; sampled and the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is sufficiently high.
;
; EXAMPLE: If you expect an LOSVD with up to a high h4 ~ 0.2 and your
; adopted penalty (BIAS) biases the solution towards a much lower h4 ~ 0.1,
; even when the measured sigma > 3*velScale and the S/N is high, then you
; are *misusing* the pPXF method!
;
; THE RECIPE: The following is a simple practical recipe for a sensible
; determination of the penalty in pPXF:
;
; 1. Choose a minimum (S/N)_min level for your kinematics extraction and
;    spatially bin your data so that there are no spectra below (S/N)_min;
;
; 2. Perform a fit of your kinematics *without* penalty (PPXF keyword BIAS=0).
;    The solution will be noisy and may be affected by spurious solutions,
;    however this step will allow you to check the expected mean ranges in
;    the Gauss-Hermite parameters [h3,h4] for the galaxy under study;
;
; 3. Perform a Monte Carlo simulation of your spectra, following e.g. the
;    included ppxf_simulation_example.pro routine. Adopt as S/N in the simulation
;    the chosen value (S/N)_min and as input [h3,h4] the maximum representative
;    values measured in the non-penalized pPXF fit of the previous step;
;
; 4. Choose as penalty (BIAS) the *largest* value such that, for sigma > 3*velScale,
;    the mean difference delta between the output [h3,h4] and the input [h3,h4]
;    is well within (e.g. delta~rms/3) the rms scatter of the simulated values
;    (see e.g. Fig.2 of Emsellem et al. 2004, MNRAS, 352, 721).
