about instrumental resolution

1) remember gandalf works with log resampled spectra

2) INT_DISP is given as sigma in km/s

3) set_constraints (l.1031) is called to set the "functargs" structure
(among other things)

functargs={CSTAR:cstar, GALAXY:galaxy, NOISE:noise, $
           EMISSION_SETUP:emission_setup, KINSTARS:kinstars, $
           VELSCALE:velscale, DEGREE:degree, MDEGREE:mdegree, $
           GOODPIXELS:goodpixels, L0_GAL:l0_gal, LSTEP_GAL:lstep_gal, $
           INT_DISP:int_disp, $ FOR_ERRORS:for_errors}

At this stage INT_DISP is still a sigma in km/s

4) functargs are passed as parameters of FITFUNC_GAS when running mpfit

5) FITFUNC_GAS calls create_templates and passes int_disp_pix =
int_disp/velscale as an argument

6) create_templates calls create_gaussn passing int_disp_pix as an argument


== TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT INSTRUMENTAL RESOLUTION WITH FIXED DLAMBDA

1) introduce new parameter in call to gandalf: INT_RES given as
sigma=FWHM/2.35 in AA at galaxy's rest frame. INT_RES must be also
included in SET_CONSTRAINTS, in the "functargs" structure, in the
parameters of FITFUNC_GAS() and of CREATE_TEMPLATES()

2) modify CREATE_TEMPLATES()
FUNCTION CREATE_TEMPLATES, EMISSION_SETUP=emission_setup, PARS=pars, NPIX=npix,$
        LSTEP_GAL=lstep_gal, INT_DISP=int_disp, INT_RES=int_res, LOG10=log10 ,$
        FOR_ERRORS=for_errors, VELSCALE=velscale

use fixed velocity dispersion or fixed resolution as needed:

INT_DISP_PIX is calculated internally using velscale and either INT_DISP or INT_RES
